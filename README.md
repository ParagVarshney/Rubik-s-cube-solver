# Rubik-s-cube-solver
A simple JavaScript-based Rubik's Cube simulator and solver (demo version). This project represents a 3Ã—3 Rubik's Cube using object-oriented programming and allows scrambling and (mock) solving of the cube. It also includes a visual display of the cube's state.
## ðŸš€ Features

- Object-oriented cube representation
- Scramble function using random moves
- Visual 3D-color grid to show cube state
- Basic structure to extend solving logic
- Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

## ðŸ§  How it Works

- Each face is represented as an array of 9 color codes (e.g., 'r', 'g', 'b', 'y', 'o', 'w').
- Scrambling applies random moves to simulate a mixed cube.
- Cube is displayed using colored divs.
- The solve function is currently a placeholder but can be extended with real logic.
